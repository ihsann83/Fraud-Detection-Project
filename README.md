# Fraud-Detection-Project

The aim of this project is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. First of all, I analyzed the data well in order to draw my roadmap and choose the correct arguments I will use. Accordingly, I examined the frequency distributions of variables. I observed variable correlations and explored multicollinearity. I showed the distribution of the target variable's classes over other variables. Also, it is useful to take missing values and outliers.

After these procedures, I moved on to the model building stage by doing the basic data pre-processing.

I started with Logistic Regression and evaluated the model performance. I applied the SMOTE technique to increase the sample for unbalanced data. Next, I rebuilt the Logistic Regression model with SMOTE applied data and I observed its effect.

Then, I used three different algorithms in the model building phase. I have applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest and the Deep Learning Neural Network algorithm

In the final step, I deployed the model using Flask API.
